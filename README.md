# Added feature
1) In the Classifieractivity.java, The code has been added inside fillCroppedBitmap() to store the captured bitmap images which are used for the detection in the sdcard.

2) Later, the same set of captured images are used any time to get the predictions at different environments if we are assigning the "croppedBitmap" variable to be the same but transformed temp_Bitmap.

3) Initally captured Bitmap is of size previewWidth X previewHeight which is resized to INPUT_SIZE X INPUT_SIZE and passed to the classifier. (different resizing can result in different prediction accuracy)

# Android YOLO with TensorFlow Mobile
This android application uses YOLOv2 model for object detection. It uses tensorflow mobile to run neural networks. I would like to use tensorflow lite later. Probably, it is the first open source implementation of the second version of YOLO for Tensorflow on Android device. The demo application detects 20 classes of Pascal VOC dataset. Please read this paper for more information about the YOLOv2 model: [YOLO9000 Better, Faster, Stronger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf).

**Train YOLO for your own dataset**

Please find more information about retraining the model on my site: https://sites.google.com/view/tensorflow-example-java-api/complete-guide-to-train-yolo. I've also added several Google Colab interactive sample for the step-by-step tutorial, so the training process can be tried out on Google virtual machines.

**Steps to compile and run the application:**

Prerequirements:

* Install the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html);
* Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher is required to run the demo application due to usage of Camera2 API;

Compile and run the project:

* Clone this repository with command: `git clone https://github.com/szaza/android-yolo-v2.git`;
* Imort your project into the Android Studio;
* Optional: put your protobuff file and labels.txt into the assets folder, then change the settings properly in the [Config.java](https://github.com/szaza/android-yolo-v2/blob/master/src/org/tensorflow/yolo/Config.java) file;
* Run the project from Android Studio;

How it works?

If you would like a more accurate solution, create a server application. See my related projects here:
